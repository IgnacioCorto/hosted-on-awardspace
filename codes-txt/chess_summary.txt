[Marilyn Manson]
Whatever doesn't kill you is gonna leave a scar

NOTE: I started to forget this old method because it is slow,
although I am a bit faster now.
--------------------------------------------------------------
CHESS DRAWS: mutual, 25, material, stalemate, repetition, perpetual,

filter:
 - opponent's last move     //this betrays his plan
 - opponent's controlled squares
 - opponent's weak squares/pieces

Fantastic Four of MiddleGame are opponents's knights and bishops,
and their purpose is to get one or two points of advantage.

 
----[The Great Pawn Hunter]----
PIECE ADVANTAGE? trade all > eat pawns > promote > checkmate. HUNT PAWNS!!
Don't leave an enemy piece in an open rank.
Opening pawn chains points towardswhere you should attack
fixating: stop pieces, then attack them
You move Opponent's pieces where you want using Sacrifices
bad bishops protect good pawns
"you are not the best player. it's only that your opponents
didn't take advantage of your holes"


**********
build defence quickly
gain flank terrain
fly until advantages appear
**********
 
knights + ESCAPE ROUTE!!   (yourhands/butterflies)
half-open/STORM/doubled/isolated   (avenues)
opponent's queen bishop worth more than the other bishop

 -> two pawns pushes help develop *ALL* minor pieces
 -> play towards the queen side, but keep an eye on king side
 -> really, pawns are the heralds of chess!!

"An advancing sacrifice is the door that connects both strategy and tactics"
"opponent must either lose a piece, or something worse"
"when you use a weapon, the next play should be another weapon"
"if you can imagine three mate positions, then your position is good!"
"AVENUES: decoys, barriers, invaders/attackers"
"Bad bishops protect good pawns." GM Mihai Suba 

* zugzwang
* zwischenzug
* lure them
- fork - don't leave an enemy open
- pin - study effects
- skewer 
- discover
- decoy - open avenues with sacrifice
+ double attack

FILTER X 10

zwischenzug:

  mate thread

  attack the pinned, 1/0

any combination, offense or defense, can be spoiled by an unexplected flying attacker
no matter the situation, "The Great Pawn Hunter"'s message is the way to live
clear advantage for the end game?? then trade it all!!
Indirect Advantage:  RxN,a8=Q,RxQ,QxR :  P+N < R
