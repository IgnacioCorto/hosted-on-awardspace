PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS:
   accept post variables? check post variables?
    - you will always check post variables:
    - user,permission,status,sanitize,validate
   is safe to use post variables as flags to run commands?
    - users can send any amount of post variables they want
    + apache can blocks big requests
    - they can send rare variables, rare values, and a valid flag or command
    - the only data inputs are: url/get/post/cookie/etc
