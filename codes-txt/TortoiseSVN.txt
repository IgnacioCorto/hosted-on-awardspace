### NOTES ###

#1: in "Switch", and in before committing, below "Commit to",
    appears the actual commit path for your working copy

#2: "Merge..." will mix the working copy with the one you choose.
    If you "Switch..." with uncommited files, it will generate a 
    "Conflicted" error

#3: The codes with a line-through, will be removed 
    from the"Merged File". Neither "Theirs" nor "Mine" will be used
