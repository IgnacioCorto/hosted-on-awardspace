to owe favors is a pact with the devil. you have your motives, but you can't
reveal them. or something like you want to reveal your motives, but it'll cause
you problems. Like Griffith and Guts. Then, to avoid your problems, you conceal
your motives.

I feel a desire to break everything, to send everything to hell. When one sees
things like that, in those painful moments, we bless people like Dictators. But
many dormant dictators are just waiting their chance, and they will do and
withstand everything, because their dream is to be a king.
