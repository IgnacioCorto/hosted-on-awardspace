=== [ MY MIND ] =======================
i should stop writing thoughts. they make me feel unsure.
 - you have free will, you have to choose, you have to improve your choices
 - *** still now, you're not thinking about code ***
 - i need to plan and analyze, but nothing is 100% true. It's your choice,
   based on your point of view. It doesn't mean it should be same choice for
   everybody. You make your choice and suffer. Happiness is being Blind.
   to accept everything as it is. But what about killing? and leisure? It's not
   the first time I ask this, but, is my situation able to be saved?
   either surrender or earn your living. What about my writings? You will
   still analyze your problems, but you must solve this one and for all.
   You can try to understand the flow of a programming language, if you want
   to write it as soft as you write spanish. Navigation is a problem, so you
   will need to develop a plan. Just like chess, you can choose any opening,
   but there are some openings that you have tested as good for you. In the end,
   it's YOUR game. You should learn to re-adapt it the middle of the way.
not enough free time, but i can't take busy time. <-- Avoid taking it!!!
contact with coworkers distracts me
when the ending hour is near, is when i regain desire.
