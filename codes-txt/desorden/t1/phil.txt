I feel the same fear that I felt in chess whe I have (1) to move a piece,
(2) to play chess, and (3) fear to lose points. What have I done to conquer
that fear, and how? How have I avoided that feeling? Learning. Accelerate it.
But accelerating means suffering.
Manus Patrick Fealy: "It happens to all people"

When I learn about a new checkmate pattern,
I don't have an opportunity to test it in a real game.
But strategy principles and patterns happen all the time.
It could be the same with programming, but tactics look good.

 - Yes is not the only way, but the best one right now.
 - And still, you have problems with planning.
 - )just do it

 - I can become crazy,blind,deaf,mute if I follow:
   1)Just do it; 2)Yes; 3)e+Motion;
 - Your heart is not that bad. You could lose all your senses, like a zodiac
   warrior, and your goal will be still pure.
 - But King of Qin was seen as a murderer!
 - 8S: suffering sacrifice suicide shame sorrow sadness surrender solitude.
   See? Now you think that 'Yes' is the way to go.

vi el txt de analisis al "control acceso" y "lista ciudades"
morfeo: el Qué es mas improtante que el Dónde y Cuándo
un pesamiento olvidado
angeles prohiben el acceso a la info

20100827.1214:
I'm sorry for not being able to analyze problems exactly the way you do.
I am the crazy one.

Haz algo. una piecesita, una pequeña parte, un ejemplo, un paso, un registro, 
un archivo, una linea, una expresion, un tag, un comando, una funcion, 
un echo, un espacio, un caracter, 
... Arranca con algo parcial, aunque este incompleto. Todo se puede mejorar.
Las oportunidades de mejora son infinitas. Siempre alguien encuentra una mejora.
Las mejoras tienen un limite, y tu tambien. Mientras no pases hambre, no hay
problema de que sigan solicitando cambios. Uno insiste en lo que quiere, y tu
quieres hacer esto, asi que, insiste! Si lo explotas, entonces lo arreglas.
Que no te ataque? Que no puedo mandarte al diablo? You are the guilty one for
letting it arrive at this point! Ahora me hablas en ingles! Es tu culpa el no
terminar la app a tiempo. Olvida el fallo de nWeb. Y tambien olvida el que te
den tiempo extra. Para que quieres tiempo? Para desperdiciarlo como siempre.
Acaso quieres andar como un loco en la calle?? Lee y escribe sobre codigos,
lee y escribe programas, lee y escribe sobre lenguages, lee y escribe codigos,
deja de perder el tiempo con otro tipo de lecturas y escrituras. Evita la mente
en blanco teniendo en tu mente la proxima actividad que debes hacer.

quiero y no quiero trabajar

Some "friends" only want to own you. And it doesn't matter if it makes them

What did I find between Laziness and Work? That finding will be similar to
Distractions and Programming.
  Distraction -vs- Programming
  Laziness    -vs- Work

20100818.1234:
You should never mix your analysis of your self with your analysis of your work.
Even if one is generated by the other, you should restrain yourself from mixing
them.

20100818.1208:
WTF?! I'm writing thoughts, but not codes!! I hate this! I need achieve some of
my dreams!

20100818.1202:
There are still people who boast and brag about how strong they are, how good
and right their decisions are. These people have chosen their half of Yin-Yang:
The instantaneous 'Yes, I do'. But we, the mentally or spiritually poor ones, 
must work with accumulation of small advantages on both realms. My approach is
not quick enough, but I try to remove all obstacles I left, for others who try
to follow my path. When you try to make a person to act like a robot, someday
it will crash. We hope it's not too late.

 - That simple thing? You only do that only thing!
 - If I don't learn, I'll be obsolete. I must keep improving.
 - Are you doing something else?
 - Of course! Everything you assign me.
 - You must make all of them. Can't you make them?
   It's your job! Don't you want it?
 - I need time.
 - Estimate your time better. You took more time than the amount you stated.
 - In how many days/minutes will you end some project?
 - Don't answer me with questions ... (a possible stagnation of
   this conversation) ... Well, 20 minutes.
 - Are you really sure?
 - Yes (focus on his times greatly, because he'll commit mistakes) ...
At this moment you superior should reveal the strategy that he either uses
or wants you to use to estimate your time. He will probably find any kind of
excuses for his mistakes, so learn from that  :-P

I'm feeling that I need music in those moments on which I'm out of inspiration,
but I'm talking about Loud Music!
I fear people around me and my music more than the loudness of my music.
I have more fear that the way I listen my music with my earphones
upsets people around me, than the possibiltity that I become deaf.

20100817.1746:
I left, but I feel sad because I'll wish to be there again.
Seize chances? Great chances are not common?
I feel Lazy, I act Lazy, but I'm not Lazy!
