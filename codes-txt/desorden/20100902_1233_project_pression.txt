i must say yes
but because of the project.
i want to keep the yes
the fear to lose,
fear of looking unreliable,
fear to break my rules and promises,
to show that i'm uncompetent,
to be responsible,

to clean, to make my art,
to art even on late night,
i want my motivation, not to lose it.
to feel that vibe, vibration,energy,
emotion,passion,
electyricity, push,
