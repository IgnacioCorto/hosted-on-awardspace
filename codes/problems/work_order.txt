- Do you fear to "many things"?

- do you fear to fix it?
- no!
- then why don't you disorder+fix?
  why don't you keep jumping between disorder and fixes?
- i want ideas
- god! there's no road, no way, no shape, no limit!
- so, should i entangle myself until i can't move?
- think fast!

***
you are surounded with tons of cords, strings, wires, ropes,
when you move, you entangle yourself more and more
you need a way out, but you get deeper

it's like swimming. you need to learn how to swim,
or like chess, or like fighing games, or winning go.
you create your own path, instead of doing the specified,
you create your own way.

create a tangled way to solve one thing or
create your own general way to solve everything
and now? what to do?
parallel thinking

what you do with your feelings, you need to do with 
your programming.
- Did you think that you already understand all people??
- Do you have total control of your feelings?
