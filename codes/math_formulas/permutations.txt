 - distractions * infinity
 - hey!! oye!! mira!!
 - achieve -vs- sacrifice
 - anxiety and surrender
 - respect the itinerary, the same way your respect:
   your parents, relatives, friends, work, wife, children

================================
 3 any order -  n!
 2/3 in group -  n!/r!
 2/3 any order - n!/(n-r)!    --> [combinations]
 3 any setup -  2^8 -> binToDec
================================

why can't I be workaholic?
 - you distract yourself with your thoughts
why can't I plan?
why all my plans have drawbacks?
 - you are hunting perfection, and that doesn't exist
why can't I withstand eternal change?
 - you fear to become obsolete
why can't I be single-headed?
why do I fear to become single-headed?
 - you should add your own improvement to your itinerary
why is difficult to start?
why do I find that way as a too long one?
why can't I start?
why do I keep repeating the same questions?
why do I don't want to do anything?
why do I prefer comfort, even after I know I'll achieve nothing with it?
 - because happiness is an illusion. will your goals make you happy?
 - make others "happy" by surrendering yours!
why my plans are not complete?
 - you don't need them complete. you need them flexible and working.
why can't I elaborate a flexible plan ??????????   <--- 
why "just do it" is not enough to move me?
why my fear to fail stops me?
why don't I want to lose, even after I know to lose is an eternal possibility?
 - don't you want to suffer? that's a too childish and naive reaction from you.
 - "love suffering", "surrender"
why don't I art, if there are many things I want to keep and achieve?
why do I need a reason or a push to make me do what I must do?
 - tunnels, elevations, subways needed destruction, as civilization needs wars
why do I need the greatest and ultimate reason to produce art?
why does it make me feel tired, frightened, impotent, incapable?
 - again, you need it flexible and working, not perfect.
 - a working one is easier than a flexible one.
 - what you condemn and criticize today, you will do tomorrow.
why do I write all this $#!% instead of coding?
 - compare code with nothing, and compare it with everything.
 - you bother your self too much
 - there are many arts to be done, enough to spoil your "happymess"
 - there are tons, milliards of, a lot of pending art
why can't I art?!
 - you only beg, but you can't contruct anything! if you can, just do it!  <---
why don't I want to construct without a plan?
why don't I want to create a mess?
why grep and find/replace are not enough for me?
 - flexible for everything, accept everything, adapt to everything,
 - raw material, clay, wood, stone,... sculpture
 - you plumb pieces, or create them.

Just do it! Why? What does it? And?

20100907.0930:
why do I hate change? WHY DO I HATE CHANGE?!!!!!!
why do I fear change?
why don't I want change?
 - insecurity, lostness. life's taste's loss.
 - everyday you learn something new ... and forget something  (wandy)
 - Metathesiophobia: unconscious protective mechanism
why "optimists" are too simplistic?
 - it's a hard work. someone has to do it. that's why we get paid.
 - it can be done. all is possible.
why there are clients I could say "sorry, but I can't do that"?
why does my idea get easily understood when I put myself as the example?

The ultimate method to overcome pain
 (1) Don't have intention to overcome pain.
 (2) Don't fear pain emotionally.
 (3) Accept pain as it is.
 (4) Just endure pain at the present moment. 


20100908.1140: "pleasure of randomness"
 - you are a device that its goal is to make decisions.
why don't I want to forget the joy of randomness?
why do I want to teach the joy of randomness to others?
 - because any possible improvement is born from random explorations
why do I think that making decisions and joy of randomness are related
 - making decisions is joy of randomness at its best!
why do I feel worried again?
 - randomness of goals. randomness of what to do, randomness of results.
 - even inputs can be random! your role in history will be defined by the amount
   of acceptance that results of your decisions have (not how good or bad)


#1: Of all bad things that happen in both extremes of our actual system, they'll
    praise the one that unites the most of people, and bury the other ones.
#2: Your role in history will be defined by the amount of acceptance
    that results of your decisions have, not how good or bad they were.
#3: How to test if an alternative is good? Who watches the Watchmen?
    How can people recognize the best alternative?
    How can people defeat those crazy materialistic bosses?
    Why should we all pay for corruption of bosses?
     - you are corrupt too. and pay for service from corrupts.
    But her actions made me this way. She was corrupted too...
     - you could corrupt her
    Corrupted by me? She believed me not. 
    But normally people are not confident of myself.
#4: I build up and increase my sadness until my guilt complex appears.
    birth, ill, pain, age, death.
     - people know you are creative, you don't create golds, but create many
       bronzes and coopers.
    stop that silly feeling of pride.
     - that's what YOU think THEY think.
#5: Ok. All those objections, problems, errors, hindrances, obstacles that you
    mention are true, but, even though they are true, you still can do something
    that can solve that problem. We only want beg you to add "little tweaks"
    after you have done it.
#6: yes, randomness, e+motion, sell, task,
    That's our task. That's what we get paid for. We do it, change it, and
    tweak it as you like, and recieve the blame for it if it doesn't work as
    expected. And still we need to be happy. Einsten Miracle Quote.
    Do you think we should simply ignore that bad side? Why don't we celebrate
    when somebody dies? or when diseased? or crippled? Or better: don't think
    about it at all. Show indifference to your friends' suffering, because it's
    bad and we should be in good mood forever, right? No! because they will
    reduce their estimation towards you. Challenges, Families, Relationship,
    Friends, ... the silly "That's another thing" answer. I hate it. I believe
    in Universal Law. Law should be applied to every[thing|one|where]. Then,
    What would my penalty be?

To create a readable code with either linear or navigable structure.
The problem is our human volatile memory for multiple variables.
Math, pencil, paper, and "dictionary" will be needed.
